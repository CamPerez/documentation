# Quickstart

Distribution empowers you, as a Seller, to manage pricing rules, filters, and blacklists for each of your Buyers connected through Travelgate. These rules can be enforced at both agency (Buyer) and provider (Seller) tiers, and can also be applied to designated hotels, date ranges, or markets. This level of control empowers you to finely tailor your company's distribution strategy.

All rules can be manually uploaded and updated through the Distribution extranet, or alternatively, you have the option to utilize various CSV files that can be stored within our FTP. Our system will then automatically load the predefined rules based on a set frequency.

It's crucial to understand that Distribution relies on static content information related to your hotels, rooms, meal plans, providers, destinations etc. This data must be integrated into the tool using master and mapping files. These master and mapping files need to be loaded onto our FTP, enabling us to effectively process this vital information.

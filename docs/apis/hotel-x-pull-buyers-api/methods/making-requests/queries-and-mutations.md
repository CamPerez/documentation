# Queries and Mutations

There are two types of allowed operations in the TravelgateX GraphQL APIs:

### Queries

Queries are “read only” and are used to get data from our system. For example, getting a list of available hotel vacancies for a particular date and location is a Query.

This operation reads values from the server using a GraphQL Object and returns JSON text as a response.

### Mutations

Mutations change, add or delete the data in our system. For example, making a booking for a vacant hotel room is a Mutation.

This operation can include inserting a new object in a database, or deleting, or updating a data record.

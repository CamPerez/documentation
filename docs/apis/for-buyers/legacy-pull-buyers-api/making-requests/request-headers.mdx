# Legacy API Request Headers

The following request headers are essential for all request methods and must be included in every API request.

### Mandatory Request Header

**Authentication**: Authentication is required for every request to the TravelgateX XML API. The authentication header employs one level of authentication, namely "Security". 

The Security level header is situated in the SOAP envelope header of all requests, where the user and password of are transmitted.

```xml
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv = "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" 
   xmlns:ns = "http://schemas.xmltravelgate.com/hub/2012/06" 
   xmlns:wsse = "http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd">
     <soapenv:Header>
       <wsse:Security>
         <wsse:UsernameToken>
           <wsse:Username>username</wsse:Username>
           <wsse:Password>password</wsse:Password>
         </wsse:UsernameToken>
       </wsse:Security>
     </soapenv:Header>
```

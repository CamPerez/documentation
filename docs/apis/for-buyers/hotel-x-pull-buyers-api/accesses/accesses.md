# Accesses

The main purpose of the Admin Query is to:

* Get list of your accesses
* Update your access

:::info

An access is the set of credentials and the authentication configuration that enables a Buyer to connect to a Seller. It is used to differentiate among Sellers and also to filter different credentials and configurations from the same Seller (e.g. B2B and B2C feeds).

:::

Some of the fields returned through the Admin Query are:

* Client names and codes
* Linked accesses and access detailed information: active/inactive, test/live, credentials, parameters, contexts, etc.
* Linked Products
* Linked Sellers
* Linked Profiles

1. **Search:** Start by checking availability for your desired dates and number of guests. You can search for one or multiple Sellers' access.

2. **Quote:** This step allows you to evaluate the rate before making a final booking decision. It provides you with the same information as the Search response, including the most up-to-date pricing, rate details, and cancellation policies.

3. **Book:** When you're ready, proceed with the Book operation. It requests a reservation confirmation using the specific optionId obtained from the Quote step.

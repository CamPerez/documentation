# Virtual Credit Card

Virtual Credit Card plugin adds the possibility to:

* **Create a virtual credit card (VCCGen):** The VCC generator plugin empowers Buyers to generate virtual credit cards featuring activation and expiration dates of their choosing. You can apply rules using the `genvcc.csv` rules file to determine whether or not to utilize a specific VCC. This decision is based on the rules defined within the file and the parameters specified in the request.


* **Cancel a virtual credit card (VCCCan):** The VCC cancel plugin is responsible for cancelling a virtual credit card identified by the id returned in the book response. The service will return the status of the payment card inside status field. This plugin should be utilized exclusively within the [Cancel](../booking-management/cancel) operation, contingent on the successful completion of the booking cancellation. To specify the virtual credit card to be used for cancellation, a rule that returns an access key will be employed, utilizing the same rule file as the VCC generator. You can establish rules within the `genvcc.csv` rule file to determine the utilization of a particular VCC based on rules within the file and request parameters.

:::caution

Bear in mind that this file is a collection of rules and we chose in every Book **the first rule that matches the criteria sent in the Query**. You should specify the more restrictive rules on the top of the file. If there is no value for any rule criteria row, it means that any value in the request matches this row. It is important to indicate the contexts used in values on the rule criteria to improve rule matching.

# Currency Converter

Currency converter plugin allows to apply currency conversion over all the prices in one option. This plugin receives an option + a currency and returns the same option with currency conversion applied over all the prices. It reads the information about rates from a file located in our ftp. Is mandatory that this file exists in the ftp and satisfies all the requirements below. Otherwise, an error will be returned.

In order for the currency converter plugin to work, you need to have the currency converter file in the FTP + add the plugin to the request.

<BrowserWindow>

F[Folder code]_[Unique code]
   HotelX_[Unique code]

```
:::note

The rate with value 1.00 is the base rate. Other rates are calculated from it.

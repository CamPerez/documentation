# Commission

Commission plugin defines the contracted/expected commission in cases where the Supplier is not able to send it via integration. The commission loaded in the FTP is considered as a Gross commission, meaning that the commission or profit is already included in the price.

To get started with the Commission plugin, follow these simple steps:

## 1. Create and upload your Commission file

First, create your commission file in the correct format and then upload it to your FTP account. To assist you with this process, you can download the template file below ‚¨áÔ∏è, add your own rules, save it in CSV format, and then upload it to the corresponding folder in your FTP.

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

üìÅF0\_0000  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üìÅHotelX_0000  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üìÅBusinessRules  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üìÑ[BuyerContext_sequential_commission.csv](../../../../../static/files/hotel-x/BuyerContext_sequential_commission.csv)

</BrowserWindow>
```

:::note

If you need assistance with requesting your credentials to access the FTP server, determining the endpoint and directory format, or learning how to upload, update, and delete FTP files, please refer to the [overview](../plugins/overview) section of Plugins.

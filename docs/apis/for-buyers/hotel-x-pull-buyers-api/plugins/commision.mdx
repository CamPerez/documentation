# Commission

Commission plugin defines the contracted/expected commission in cases where the Supplier is not able to send it via integration. The commission loaded in the FTP is considered as a Gross commission, meaning that the commission or profit is already included in the price.

In order for the commission plugin to work, you need to have the commission file in the FTP + add the plugin to the request.

### Create Commission file

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

F[Folder code]_[Unique code]
   HotelX_[Unique code]
      BusinessRules
         [Context Source]_sequential_commission.csv

</BrowserWindow>
```

Download the file, include your data following the example (delete the first line), save it in csv format, and upload it to your FTP following the example.


:::note

You need to create one file for each Supplier.

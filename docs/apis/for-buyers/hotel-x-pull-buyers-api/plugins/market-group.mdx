# Market Group

Market Group plugin groups the input markets from Search depending on the agrupations you’ve decided beforehand. In order to be able to use the plugin, you’ll have to decide which markets to join for which supplier. This way the Search will only process as many transactions as groups have been formed by the plugin, since all of the markets of a same group would return the same options.

In order for the market group plugin to work, you need to have the market group file in the FTP + add the plugin to the request.

### Create Market Group file

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

F[Folder code]_[Unique code]
   HotelX_[Unique code]
      BusinessRules
         markets_groups.csv

</BrowserWindow>
```

Download the file, include your data following the example (delete the first line), save it in csv format, and upload it to your FTP following the example.


:::caution

Bear in mind that this plugin is only available in Search step and the market groups will not be recalculated after Search step. So if you take an option from Search that has been executed with market groups, those groups will remain the same through all the booking flow, even if you change those groups via ftp.

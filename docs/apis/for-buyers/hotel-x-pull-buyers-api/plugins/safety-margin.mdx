# Safety Margin

Safety Margin plugin allows discarding options that have a commission lower than expected. Only options that have a commission over gross, equal or lower than those reported in the file will be returned. 

The expected commission has to be loaded in a safety-margin file. Sequentially, the rules will be evaluated until a match is found, upon finding it, the process will be stopped and the commission will be evaluated. In the same way, if the rule is not found, the option will be validated.

The matching process uses the `clientTokens` field, which identify the provided by the client and it is used to filter which business rules can be applied in the request sent.

To get started with the Preference plugin, follow these simple steps:

##  1.Create and upload your Safety Margin file

First, create your safety margin file in the correct format and then upload it to your FTP account. To assist you with this process, you can download the template file below, add your own rules, save it in CSV format, and then upload it to the corresponding folder in your FTP.

# Safety Margin

Safety Margin plugin allows discarding options that have a commission lower than expected. Only options that have a commission over gross, equal or lower than those reported in the file will be returned. 

The expected commission has to be loaded in a safety-margin file. Sequentially, the rules will be evaluated until a match is found, upon finding it, the process will be stopped and the commission will be evaluated. In the same way, if the rule is not found, the option will be validated.

The matching process uses client Tokens filed, which identify the provided by the client and it is used to filter which business rules can be applied in the request sent.

In order for the safety margin plugin to work, you need to have the safety margin file in the FTP + add the plugin to the request.

### Create Safety Margin file

```mdx-code-block
<BrowserWindow>

F[Folder code]_[Unique code]
   HotelX_[Unique code]
      BusinessRules
         [Context Source]_sequential_safetymargin.csv

</BrowserWindow>
```

Download the file, include your data following the example (delete the first line), save it in csv format, and upload it to your FTP following the example.

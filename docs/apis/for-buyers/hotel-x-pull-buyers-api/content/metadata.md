# Metadata

The Metadata Query returns a clear and summarized view of the Seller's main characteristics, as well as the methods implemented through their integration and the limitations and restrictions associated with their connection. The returned fields include:

* Methods implemented
* Maximum/minimum stay
* Minimum release
* Supported payment types
* Maximum pax per room
* Maximum rooms per reservation
* Cancellation policies returned in Search or Quote
* “RequiredAllPassengers” (if name details for all the paxes are required in BookRQ)

*Note that TravelgateX API specifications will always prevail over the Seller's specifications. For instance, nationality should always be sent in SearchRQ even though it may be optional for some Sellers.

Since Metadata information may not be updated by our Sellers frequently (they update it whenever there is a major update on their APIs), we suggest you confirm directly with them whether the information is up to date.

# Boards

* Code
* Board Code
* Text

### Criteria   

This query offers versatility in search options, with certain fields marked as mandatory (access) and others as optional (boardCodes and group). This flexibility empowers you to create a personalized Boards Query, tailoring the requested fields to your specific needs. Consequently, the response will only include information that is highly relevant to you, streamlining the retrieval process and ensuring the data you receive meets your exact requirements.

### Mapping

When utilizing the Boards List Query, you will receive the Seller's native boards codes. Connecting with a new Seller doesn't always mean that you are interested in the whole board's portfolio, maybe you are just interested in some specific boards. Since mapping depends entirely on your side, you can map only those boards you are interested in.

Additionally, you can upload your own mapping files to our FTP (credentials should be provided by our Customer Care team), and we will use your own boards codes in the booking flow.

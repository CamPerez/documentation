# Overview

The Content methods grant access to crucial static information from Sellers, including details like the hotel and destination lists. To effectively manage content methods, become familiar with the calls such as Hotel-List,  Destinations, HotelRoom, HotelBoard, HotelCategory and Metadata.

We highly advise our Buyers to incorporate content calls into their systems since supplier codes may vary from those obtained through our API. This is a critical step to ensure seamless integration and accurate data retrieval. Particularly noteworthy is the metadata call, which holds utmost significance when establishing a connection with a Seller. Through this call, comprehensive information regarding restrictions and settings specific to that Seller can be obtained, ensuring a well-informed and efficient partnership.

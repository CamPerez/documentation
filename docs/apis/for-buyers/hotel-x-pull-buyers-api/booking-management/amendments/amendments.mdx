# Overview

The Amendment operations allow you to amend different aspects of a booking. There are currently five amendment operations available:

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items.filter((item, i) => i > 0)}/>

Each amendment type must be performed in two steps, `Query` (quotes the amendment) and `Mutation` (commits the amendment). In both steps the returned fields include:

* The booking detail with the amendment applied
* Amendment fees if applicable
* AmendmentID (Only returned in the query response)

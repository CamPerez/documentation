# Cancel

The cancel operation allows you to cancel a booking made via TravelgateX. The returned fields include:

* `status`
* `reference`
* `price`
* `holder`
* `hotel`
* `rooms`
* `rates`

:::caution

Cancellation always takes into account the day and time of the destination in order to calculate what cancellation policy should be applied. UTC time.

:::note

The information returned in Cancel response may vary between Sellers.

## Inputs

When creating your cancel query, you have two different inputs to fill based on your specific needs:

1. Criteria
2. Settings

```graphql
mutation {
    hotelX {
    cancel
      criteria: {}
      settings: {}
	}
}
```

### 1. Input

This mutation offers versatility in cancellation, with all fields marked as optional (accessCode, language, hotelCode etc.). You can decide between the two options for cancellation, either by reference or by bookingID, empowering you with the choice that suits you best.

To specify your cancel input you need to use the input `HotelCancelInput` in your mutation variables.

If you cancel using only the `bookingID` from the book response:

```json
{
    "input" : {
        "bookingID" : "1@1[241028[241029[230918[1[es[EUR[2[test_0123456789[2596391"
    }
}
```

If you cancel using the `accessCode`, `hotelCode` and `reference` from the book response:

```json
{
    "input" : {
        "accessCode" : "2",
        "hotelCode" : "1",
        "reference" : {
            "supplier" : "2596391"
        }
    }
}
```

**Optional criteria**
* `reference`
* `bookingID`
* `accessCode`
* `language`
* `hotelCode`


:::danger

Even if not all criteria are marked as mandatory, you must either use the bookingID from the book response or provide the set of all other criteria, including the access code, hotel, and reference, to cancel the reservation.

:::

### 2. Settings 

Settings are the common configurations used to construct requests to the supplier/s. By default, we apply the same configuration to all Hotel-X clients.

To specify your quote settings you need to use the input `HotelSettingsInput` in your query variables:

```json
{
	"settings": {
		"client": "client_demo",
		"context": "HOTELTEST",
		"testMode": true,
		"auditTransactions": false,
		"timeout": 60000
	}
}
```

**Mandatory Settings:**
* `context`
* `timeout` (timeout in milliseconds for supplier connections. Applied to all suppliers; won't close client connection if exceeded)
* `businessRules`
* `language`
* `currency`
* `nationality`
* `markets`

**Optional Settings:**
* `group`
* `auditTransactions` 
* `suppliers` (each one contains its own code, settings and accesses)
* `plugins`
* `testMode` (this flag allows only the accesses checked as test)
* `clientTokens` (used to identify the origin of the request, this is only used in plugins)
* `commitRequired` (indicates if the book will be confirmed in 1 or 2 steps. It only should be used in Book)



### Requests Examples

## Response

Once a Cancel (Cancellation) method is run, our API response will provide its cancel status. This status represents the current status of the cancellation and can be categorized into four possible values:

| Status         | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CANCELLED      | The reservation is cancelled.                                                                                                                                    |
| OK             | The reservation status is OK, is not cancelled.
| ON_REQUEST     | The reservation was completed but the product is still not available by the Seller, so the reservation goes into a waiting list. It is the Buyer’s responsibility to check if the booking is OK. |
| UNKNOWN        | The cancellation process through TravelgateX was completed but due to a supplier error or a timeout, the reservation status is unknown. It is the Buyer’s responsibility to check if the booking is cancelled.   

:::caution

If you receive any of the "common errors" or a status other than "CANCELLED", it will be your responsibility as a Buyer to check the final status of the cancellation in the Seller's system.

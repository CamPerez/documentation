# Booking list

The Booking operation allows to retrieve a booking (or bookings) with all its details from the booking id or reference locator. The returned fields for each booking in the list include:

* `holder`
* `hotel`
* `price`
* `remarks`
* `status`

## Inputs

When creating your cancel query, you have three different inputs to fill based on your specific needs:

1. Criteria
2. Settings
3. Filter

```graphql
query {
    hotelX {
    booking
      criteria: {}
      settings: {}
	  filter: {}
	}
}
```

:::note

Remember that you can choose the information you want displayed:
* `reference`: To display client or supplier booking reference
* `status`: To display the booking status

:::

### Criteria 

This query offers versatility in booking search, with all fields marked as optional (accessCode, typeSearch, language etc.). This flexibility empowers you to create a personalized Booking List Query, tailoring the requested fields to your specific needs. 

To specify your quote criteria you need to use the input `HotelCriteriaBookingInput` in your query variables:

```json
{
    "criteria" : {
        "bookingID" : "1@1[241028[241029[230918[1[es[EUR[2[test_0123456789[2596391"
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "criteria" : {
        "accessCode" : "2",
        "typeSearch" : "REFERENCES",
        "references" : {
            "hotelCode" : "1",
            "currency" : "EUR",
            "references" : [
                {
                    "client" : "test_0123456789"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "criteria" : {
        "accessCode" : "2",
        "typeSearch" : "DATES",
        "dates" : {
            "dateType" : "ARRIVAL",
            "start" : "2024-10-28",
            "end" : "2024-10-28"
        }
    }
}
```

**Optional criteria**
* `accessCode` (necessary if you search by references or by dates)
* `typeSearch` (necessary if you search by references or by dates)
* `language`
* `dates` (to receive a list of all the reservations made in a specific type frame)
* `bookingID` (to receive the details of a specific reservation)
* `references` (to receive the details of a specific reservation)

:::danger

Even if not all criteria are marked as mandatory, you must either use the bookingID from the book response or provide the set of all other criteria, including the access code, hotel, and reference, to read the reservation.

### Settings 

Settings are the common configurations used to construct requests to the supplier/s. By default, we apply the same configuration to all Hotel-X clients.

To specify your booking settings you need to use the input `HotelSettingsInput` in your query variables:

```json
{
	"settings": {
		"client": "client_demo",
		"context": "HOTELTEST",
		"testMode": true,
		"auditTransactions": false,
		"timeout": 60000
	}
}
```

**Mandatory Settings:**
* `context`
* `timeout` (Timeout in milliseconds for supplier connections. Applied to all suppliers; won't close client connection if exceeded)
* `businessRules`
* `language`
* `currency`
* `nationality`
* `markets`

**Optional Settings:**
* `group`
* `auditTransactions` 
* `suppliers` (Each one contains its own code, settings and accesses)
* `plugins`
* `testMode` (This flag allows only the accesses checked as test)
* `clientTokens` (Used to identify the origin of the request, this is only used in plugins)

### Filter

Filters allow you to precisely tailor the response according to your preferences. To specify your filters you need to use the input `HotelXFilterInput` in your query variables. The available filter in booking is:

* `plugin`: You can filter and specify which plugins need to be included or excluded.

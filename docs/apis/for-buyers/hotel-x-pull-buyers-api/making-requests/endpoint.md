# Endpoint

One advantage of GraphQL is the convenience of a single endpoint for all operations. You can access the Hotel-X API methods in both test and production environments using this endpoint: 

```bash
https://api.travelgatex.com
```

China endpoint: If your servers are located in China you can use the following endpoint to improve performance: 

```bash
http://api-cn.travelgatex.com
```

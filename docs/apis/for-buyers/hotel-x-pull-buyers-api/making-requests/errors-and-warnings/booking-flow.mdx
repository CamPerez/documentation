# Booking flow

Hotel-X can return errors or warnings as the severity of these issues can vary. These errors or warnings may be directly generated by the Hotel-X API layer, or they could be transmitted from the Seller's system in cases where they encounter errors on their end.

Below, you will find the list of the possible values that you will receive.

### Errors List

Errors are situations where the service has been terminated for some reason. Each error returned by the Hotel-X API layer has an alphabetic code and a type. Here, you will find the various options and their explanations.

| Code                 | Type             | Description                       | Explanation   |

# Hotel-X Settings

In all booking flow and booking management requests, you'll find certain fields that you need to fill in. These include the `HotelSettingsInput` and `criteria` inputs. These fields contain various elements, some of which are known as `settings`. These settings are the common configurations used to construct your requests to the supplier/s. They consist of fields that are frequently needed, like `language`, `currency`, and `timeout`.

You have the flexibility to fill in these settings with different values for each of your `query` and `mutation` requests. However, to make things easier, you can also choose not to fill them in every time, especially if you know the values will remain the same. In such cases, we have default settings. These default settings are the values we'll use in the background if you don't specify the fields that are part of these settings.

When you begin using TravelgateX, these settings are automatically created, but it's essential to review and update them according to your preferences in our [API Settings](https://app.travelgatex.com/connections/settings) website section.

## Default Settings

We'll clarify which fields are categorized as `settings` and where you can locate them. We'll also specify whether it's mandatory to provide a value for each field or if you have the option to leave it empty, in which case the default settings will be applied:

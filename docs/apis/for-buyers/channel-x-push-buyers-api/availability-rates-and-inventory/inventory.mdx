## Frequently asked questions

<details>
    <summary>How do I know whether it is a Full Copy or a Delta?</summary>
    <div>
        <div>Full Copy will transmit significantly more information than a simple Delta. Additionally, it will be indicated in the attribute value as "FullCopy" or "Delta."</div>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What does New, Delta and Remove mean?</summary>
    <div>
        <div>Rates can be created, deleted or modified. "New" means a newly added rate, "Delta" is for a changed rate, and "Removed" is used when a rate is deleted.</div>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What happens if a rate is deleted, does Travelgate inform us of this in the Full Copy?</summary>
    <div>
        <div>Not in the Full Copy. If a rate is deleted and you run a Full Copy, you'll only receive the currently loaded information. Notification about the removed rate will come through a Delta after its deletion.</div>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What does CancelPenalty Start and End dates represent?</summary>
    <div>
        <div>The Start and End dates indicate the period during which the cancellation policies will be in effect. Both the start and end days are included in the cancellation policy range.</div>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Can the RatePlanStatusType be set to Deactivated for specific periods?</summary>
    <div>
        <div>The RatePlanStatusType set to Deactivated is utilized to deactivate a rate, with the option for either an indefinite deactivation or a specified timeframe. If choosing the latter, you'll need to define the date range (start and end) to signify the specific duration for deactivating the rate.</div>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>If RatePlanInventory ARI provided `MealsIncluded` `MealPlanCodes` = `"??"/`, then the Supplement attribute will be present, is this correct? And, is it possible for it to show up when Mealplancode is âRoom Onlyâ?</summary>
    <div>
        <div>The RatePlanInventory informs of what the base MealPlan for this rate is (Room only, Bed and Breakfast, All Inclusive, etc). A base rate cannot have more than one MealPlan. The Supplement is not indicated here, it is indicated in the RatePlanNotif. The MealPlanCode displayed in MealsIncluded is the push system code for the meal plans which can be found in the code list in the static infomration.</div>
    </div>

# Overview

In the case of the Channel-X API, Travelgate will send requests to the Buyer's system, and the Buyer will reply with either success or error. Channel-X has three main methods. You need to set up your system to handle the following requests:

* `HotelRatePlanInventoryNotif`, which contains information about the inventory setup: Hotel, Rate and Room.
* `HotelAvailNotif`, which contains information about rate availability and allotment conditions.
* `HotelRatePlanNotif`, which contains information about rate prices and supplements.

:::note

Buyers access the [Full Copy](../fullcopy-and-deltas/fullcopy-and-deltas.mdx) tab to obtain all product details. Subsequently, Channel-X sends [Delta](../fullcopy-and-deltas/fullcopy-and-deltas.mdx) requests for updates made by the Channel Manager.

:::

After each request, a response should be provided from the Buyer's side. For instance, if a `HotelAvailNotif` request is received, a corresponding `HotelAvailNotif` response should be sent, and so forth. There are two response options, success or error.

:::caution

If you don't retrieve information for a specific range of dates that were previously loaded into the system, refrain from overwriting them. This indicates that the conditions for those days, which do not appear in the request, remain unchanged.

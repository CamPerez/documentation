# Inventory Tool

Since Channel-X solution is integrated with Inventory, first of all you must use our [Inventory Extranet](https://inventory.xmltravelgate.com/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f) in order to configure the setup for the hotels, rates and rooms contracted with the hoteliers, so that your Channel Managers can map them as well. Once mapped, the Channel Manager will load and update availability and prices for the hotels, rates and rooms configured.

After completing this preliminary step, the `HotelRatePlanInventoryNotif` message will send information about the inventory setup (Hotel, Rate, and Room) to your system.

The `HotelAvailNotif` and `HotelRatePlanNotif` messages will transmit information regarding the availability and rates pushed by the Channel Manager to your system.

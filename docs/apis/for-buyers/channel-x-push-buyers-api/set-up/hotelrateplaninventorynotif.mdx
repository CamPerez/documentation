# HotelRatePlanInventoryNotif

The HotelRatePlanInventoryNotif message contains information about the inventory setup information that should be followed by the structure: Hotel > Rate > Room.

Each element can have one of these three states: `New`, `Delta`, `Remove`, each one will be indicated in its correspondent tag.

* `New`: it means the element was not added before. You should add the element in your system with the information provided.

* `Delta` (Edit): it means the element was created before but it has been edited. The element should be already created in your system and you should change the information of it with the new one. 

:::note

You will get all the information of the element, as we need to provide it, but it is not extrictly necessary that all of this info has changed, it could only change a part of it. You can override all the information already loaded for that specific element and reload it with the new one or have control of what has changed.

:::

* `Remove`: it means the element has been removed. You should delete the element in your system and all its dependences. 

:::note

When deleting an element (Hotel, rate, derived rate or room), all the information you will receive about the element in the request is the code. If this happens, you should remove from your system all the elements that are depending on the one to delete.

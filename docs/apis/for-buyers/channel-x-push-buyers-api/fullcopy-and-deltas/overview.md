# Overview

Now that you have your system configured to handle our Availability, Rates, and Inventory (ARI) requests, and both you have completed the setup of the hotel, rates, and rooms, while the Seller has pushed availability and rates to inventory, it's time for you to start receiving products in your system.

For the initial setup, load all products into your system using the **Full Copy** tab in the [Inventory's extranet](https://inventory.xmltravelgate.com/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f). Subsequently, updates from the Channel Manager will be sent in a **Delta** format, notifying you of real-time changes, such as price and availability, to ensure you have up-to-date product information.

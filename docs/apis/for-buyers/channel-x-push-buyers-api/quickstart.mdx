# Quickstart

## Introduction

Channel-X extracts the product loaded between the Buyer and the Channel Managers into our Inventory system and sends it to the Buyer's system. Buyers have two options for loading product into their system: they can select the **Full Copy** tab in Inventory's extranet to load all the product, or they can select specific hotels to copy.

When the Channel Manager makes an update, Channel-X sends a smaller product request **(Delta)** to notify buyers of the change. This is because Channel-X only sends information that has changed, and it is able to detect what information has changed and which is duplicated.

Please note that connecting with Channel Managers through TravelgateX requires a previous step in which the Buyer configures the setup of the hotels, rates, and rooms contracted with the hoteliers in the Inventory extranet. This configuration allows the Channel Manager to map all this information and push availability and prices for the Buyer.

:::caution

Channel-X Push Buyers API is a non-standalone API that exclusively retrieves to the Buyer's system product that have been previously pushed to the [Inventory tool](https://inventory.xmltravelgate.com/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f). To enable bookings, it is essential to also develop [Hotel-X Pull Buyers API](../hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) (if you already have the Legacy Pull Buyers API developed, it is also possible to work with it).

:::

## Let's get started: How to push product to your system!

Channel-X provides a robust XML-based API that will enable you to push all the product to your system, allowing you to create and display price calendars. Additionally, you will have full synchronization of products whenever needed, reducing network latency for availability searches, as there is no need to access an external system.

### Prerequisites

#### API Endpoint

In the case of Channel-X API, it is necessary for you to send the endpoint to Travelgate.

#### Request Headers

To interact with the API, you'll need to configure your system to accept the following headers:

* Content Type: Content-Type header provides with the actual content type of the returned content.

```html
Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8
``` 

* SOAPAction: SOAPAction header corresponding to the transmitted message, there are 3 different ones, one for each request.

```html
SOAPAction: http://schemas.xmltravelgate.com/hubpush/provider/2012/10/IProviderGen/HotelRatePlanInventoryNotif
```

```html
SOAPAction: http://schemas.xmltravelgate.com/hubpush/provider/2012/10/IProviderGen/HotelAvailNotif
```

```html
SOAPAction: http://schemas.xmltravelgate.com/hubpush/provider/2012/10/IProviderGen/HotelRatePlanNotif
```

* Authentication: Combination of username and password (which you should have sent to us beforehand) encoded in Base64 format.

```html
Authorization: Basic aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g/dj1RWWg2bVlJSkcyWQ==
``` 

#### Supported Operations

### 1. Inventory SetUp

Since Channel-X solution is integrated with Inventory, you should use our [Inventory Extranet](https://inventory.xmltravelgate.com/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f) in order to configure the setup for the hotels, rates and rooms contracted with the hoteliers, so that your Channel Managers can map them as well. Once mapped, the Channel Manager will load and update availability and prices for the hotels, rates and rooms configured.

To learn how to set up hotels, rates, and rooms in the Inventory tool, please refer to the [SetUp section](#) within Inventory.

### 2. Channel-X pushes the information to your system

You will have two options for loading products into your system: you can either select the **Full Copy** tab in the Inventory's extranet to load all the products, or you can choose specific hotels to copy. The purpose of this is to initially receive the products into your system, and subsequently, to obtain a complete refresh of the product.

Afterward, each update received from the Channel Manager will be pushed into your system. These smaller product requests, aimed at notifying buyers of changes (such as price, availability, or inventory level), are referred to as **Delta**. Their purpose is to receive real-time changes to ensure that the product information is kept up to date.

:::note

After receiving the initial element of the Full Copy, please keep in mind that you will need to either discard the loaded information, overwrite it with all the incoming information for that hotel, or perform a proper merge with the changing information.

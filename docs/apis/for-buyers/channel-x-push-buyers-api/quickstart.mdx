# Quickstart

## Introduction

Channel-X extracts the product loaded between the Buyer and the Channel Managers into our Inventory tool and sends it to the Buyer's system. To get all the product details into their system, Buyers just need to go to the **Full Copy** tab in the Inventory's extranet. Once that's done, when the Channel Manager makes changes, Channel-X sends a smaller request **(Delta)** to let Buyers know about the updates.

Please, note that connecting with Channel Managers through TravelgateX requires a previous step in which the Buyer configures the setup of the hotels, rates, and rooms contracted with the hoteliers in the [Inventory extranet](https://inventory.xmltravelgate.com/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f). This configuration allows the Channel Manager to map all this information and push availability and prices for the Buyer.

:::caution

Channel-X Push Buyers API is a non-standalone API that exclusively retrieves to the Buyer's system product that have been previously pushed to the [Inventory tool](https://inventory.xmltravelgate.com/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f). To enable bookings, it is essential to also develop [Hotel-X Pull Buyers API](../hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) (if you already have the [Legacy Pull Buyers API](../legacy-pull-buyers-api/overview) developed, it is also possible to work with it).

:::

## Let's Get Started: How to Push Product to your System!

Channel-X provides a robust XML-based API that will enable you to push all the product to your system, allowing you to create and display price calendars. Additionally, you will have full synchronization of products whenever needed, reducing network latency for availability searches.

### 1. Configure your system to operate with Channel-X

#### API Endpoint

For the Channel-X API, it is essential that you [send your endpoint to Travelgate](making-requests/endpoint).

#### Request Headers

To interact with the API, you'll need to configure your system to accept the following headers:

* Content Type: Content-Type header provides information about the actual content type of the returned content.

```html
Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8
``` 

* SOAPAction: SOAPAction header corresponding to the transmitted message, there are 3 different ones, one for each request.

```html title="HotelRatePlanInventoryNotif"
SOAPAction: http://schemas.xmltravelgate.com/hubpush/provider/2012/10/IProviderGen/HotelRatePlanInventoryNotif
```

```html title="HotelAvailNotif"
SOAPAction: http://schemas.xmltravelgate.com/hubpush/provider/2012/10/IProviderGen/HotelAvailNotif
```

```html title="HotelRatePlanNotif"
SOAPAction: http://schemas.xmltravelgate.com/hubpush/provider/2012/10/IProviderGen/HotelRatePlanNotif
```

* Authentication: Combination of username and password ([which you should have previously sent to us](making-requests/endpoint)) encoded in Base64 format.

```html
Authorization: Basic xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
``` 

#### Supported Operations

In the case of the Channel-X API, Travelgate will send requests to the Buyer's system, and the Buyer will respond with either success or error.

**Requests**

Channel-X has three main methods. You will have to configure your system to accept the following requests: 
* `HotelRatePlanInventoryNotif`, which contains information about the inventory setup: Hotel, Rate and Room.
* `HotelAvailNotif`, which contains information about rate availability and allotment conditions.
* `HotelRatePlanNotif`, which contains information about rate prices and supplements.

**Responses**

After each request, a response should be provided from your side. For instance, if a `HotelAvailNotif` request is received, a corresponding `HotelAvailNotif` response should be sent, and so forth. There are two response options, **success** or **error**.


```html title="Success"
<HotelAvailNotifResponse xmlns = "http://schemas.xmltravelgate.com/hubpush/provider/2012/10">
    <HotelAvailNotifResult>
        <Success xmlns = "http://www.opentravel.org/OTA/2003/05"/>
    </HotelAvailNotifResult>
</HotelAvailNotifResponse>
```


```html title="Error"
<HotelAvailNotifResponse xmlns = "http://schemas.xmltravelgate.com/hubpush/provider/2012/10">
    <HotelAvailNotifResult>
        <Errors xmlns = "http://www.opentravel.org/OTA/2003/05">
            <Error ShortText = "HotelCode or RatePlanList not found" Code = "2"/>
        </Errors>
    </HotelAvailNotifResult>
</HotelAvailNotifResponse>
```

### 2. Inventory tool SetUp

Since Channel-X solution is integrated with the Inventory tool, you must use our [Inventory extranet](https://inventory.xmltravelgate.com/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f) in order to configure the setup for the hotels, rates and rooms contracted with the hoteliers, so that the Channel Managers can map them as well. Once mapped, the Channel Manager will load and update availability and prices for the hotels, rates and rooms configured beforehand.

![SetUp Inventory](../../../../static/img/docs/channel-x/setup-inventory.png)

:::tip

To learn how to set up hotels, rates, and rooms in the Inventory tool, please refer to the [Inventory SetUp section](#).

:::

### 3. Channel-X pushes the information to your system

You will have two options for loading products into your system: you can either select the **Full Copy** tab in the Inventory's extranet to load all the products, or you can choose specific hotels to copy. The purpose of this is to initially receive the products into your system, and subsequently, to obtain a complete refresh of the product.

![FullCopy Inventory](../../../../static/img/docs/channel-x/fullcopy-inventory.png)

Afterward, each update received from the Channel Manager will be pushed into your system. These smaller product requests, aimed at notifying buyers of changes (such as price, availability, or inventory level), are referred to as **Delta**. Their purpose is to receive real-time changes to ensure that the product information is kept up to date.


## Next steps

Congratulations on completing this quickstart tutorial! 🎉 You've successfully learned the basics of retrieveing Channel Managers product to your system. But there's a world of knowledge waiting for you:

- Explore the [Making Requests](./making-requests/endpoint) section to dive deep into how our XML API works and maximize its performance.
- Discover various methods/messages grouped by the following actions:
    - [Inventory](./availability-rates-and-inventory/inventory): Retrieve the inventory setup (hotel, rate, room).
    - [Availability](./availability-rates-and-inventory/availability) and [Rate](./availability-rates-and-inventory/rates): Retrieve rate availability, allotment conditions and rate prices and supplements.
- Don't forget to perform the [SetUp in the Inventory Tool](inventory-tool) before proceeding with your first [Full Copy](fullcopy-and-deltas)!

To enable bookings, it is essential to develop [Hotel-X Pull Buyers API](../hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart.mdx) (if you already have the [Legacy Pull Buyers API](../legacy-pull-buyers-api/overview) developed, it is also possible to work with it).

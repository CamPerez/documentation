# Overview

TravelgateX offers tailored API solutions to enhance travel operations.

For Buyers, the [Hotel-X Pull Buyers API](../apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) and [Legacy Pull Buyers API](../apis/for-buyers/legacy-pull-buyers-api/overview.md) enable real-time transactions, delivering immediate and comprehensive responses. In contrast, the [Channel-X Push Buyers API](../apis/for-buyers/channel-x-push-buyers-api/quickstart) delivers hotel product data to Buyers' systems in a static format, while still enabling real-time reservations with the support of Hotel-X.

For Sellers, the [Hotel Pull Sellers API](../apis/for-sellers/hotel-pull-sellers-api/overview) supports real-time interactions. Meanwhile, the [Hotel Push Sellers API](../apis/for-sellers/hotel-push-sellers-api/overview) allows suppliers to submit their hotel content to our database in a static manner, ensuring that Buyers can access it while maintaining real-time reservation capabilities.

Whether you're a Buyer or Seller, we have the right API for you! ðŸ˜Š

# Overview

TravelgateX offers tailored API solutions to enhance travel operations.

For Buyers, the [Hotel-X Pull Buyers API](../apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) and [Legacy Pull Buyers API](../apis/for-buyers/legacy-pull-buyers-api/overview.md) enable real-time transactions, delivering immediate and comprehensive responses. In contrast, the [Channel-X Push Buyers API](../apis/for-buyers/channel-x-push-buyers-api/quickstart) delivers hotel product data to Buyers' systems in a static format, while still enabling real-time reservations with the support of Hotel-X.

On the other side, for Sellers, the [Hotel Pull Sellers API](./for-sellers/hotel-pull-sellers-api/quickstart) supports real-time interactions, while the [Hotel Push Sellers API](./for-sellers/hotel-push-sellers-api/quickstart.mdx) retrieves content statically while ensuring real-time reservation capabilities.

# Overview

TravelgateX provides customized API solutions to optimize travel operations. 

On one side, for Buyers, the [Hotel-X Pull Buyers API](../apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart) and [Legacy Pull Buyers API](../apis/for-buyers/legacy-pull-buyers-api/overview.md) facilitate real-time transactions, providing instant and detailed responses. In contrast, the [Channel-X Push Buyers API](../apis/for-buyers/channel-x-push-buyers-api/quickstart) retrieves content in a static format but enables real-time reservations with the assistance of Hotel-X. 

On the other side, for Sellers, the [Hotel Pull Sellers API](../apis/for-sellers/hotel-pull-sellers-api/overview) supports real-time interactions, while the [Hotel Push Sellers API](../apis/for-sellers/hotel-push-sellers-api/overview) retrieves content statically while ensuring real-time reservation capabilities.

# Overview

Providers need to implement the `HotelRatePlanInventoryNotif` message to setup the product (hotel, rate, room). Using the `HotelRatePlanInventoryRetrieve` message, they will be able to retrieve the static product (hotel, rate, room) to map the hotelier inventory into their system.

The `HotelRatePlanNotif` and `HotelAvailNotif` messages allow providers to synchronize hotelier rates and availability. Optionally, providers can retrieve all the properties of their product loaded on our system using the `HotelAvailRetrieve` and `HotelRatePlanRetrieve` messages.

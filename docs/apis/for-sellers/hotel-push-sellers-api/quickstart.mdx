# Quickstart

## Introduction

By combining Inventory and the Hotel Push Sellers API, Channel Managers and Hotel Product Distributors can **push** their products into a TravelgateX database, making them accessible to TravelgateX Buyers.

Inventory receives the data from the different channels and stores it in a common structure. Then, this product can be consumed in 3 different ways by TravelgateX Buyers: via Pull with our [Hotel-X solution](../apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart), via Push with our [Channel-X solution](../apis/for-buyers/channel-x-push-buyers-api/quickstart) or via a Flat File solution.

# Quickstart

## Introduction

By combining the Hotel Push Sellers API and [Inventory Tool](https://inventory.xmltravelgate.com/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f), Channel Managers and Hotel Product Distributors can **push** their product into a TravelgateX database, making it accessible to TravelgateX Buyers.

As a common practice, Buyers frequently configure the setup (hotels, rates, and rooms) within the Inventory Extranet. Subsequently, Sellers typically push both availability and rates. Consequently, TravelgateX Buyers gain access to this product through three distinct methods: either through Pull, using our [Hotel-X solution](../../for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/quickstart), through Push, utilizing our [Channel-X solution](../../for-buyers/channel-x-push-buyers-api/quickstart), or via a Flat File solution.

## Let's Get Started: How to Make your First Sale!

The Hotel Push Sellers API provides a robust XML-based API that will enable you to push all your products to our Inventory tool, making them accessible for buyers. If you're a Channel Manager or Supplier seeking a push integration, please follow the next steps.

### Prerequisites

#### API Endpoint

Hotel Push Seller API, being a XML-based API, utilizes a single endpoint for all operations:

```html
https://pushprovider.xmltravelgate.com/Service/Hotel/Provider/ProviderGEN.svc
```

#### Request Headers

To interact with the API, you'll need to include the Authentication request header:

Authentication: Authentication header employs two levels of authentication, namely "Security" and "POS"

1. Security Level: User and password of our Inventory Tool System are transmitted.

2. POS Level: It comprises two fields: RequestorID, which represents the seller code assigned to initiate the request, and CompanyName, which signifies the buyer code assigned to receive the updates.

```html
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV = "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:ns1 = "http://www.opentravel.org/OTA/2003/05" xmlns:ns2 = "http://schemas.xmltravelgate.com/hubpush/provider/2012/10" xmlns:ns3 = "http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd">
 <SOAP-ENV:Header>
     <ns3:Security SOAP-ENV:mustUnderstand = "1">
         <ns3:UsernameToken>
             <ns3:Username>XXXXX</ns3:Username>
             <ns3:Password>XXXXXXX</ns3:Password>
         </ns3:UsernameToken>
     </ns3:Security>
 </SOAP-ENV:Header>
 <SOAP-ENV:Body>
     <ns:HotelRatePlanNotif><!--Your request, ex: HotelAvailNotif, HotelRatePlanInventoryRetrieve ...-->
         <ns:request>
             <ns1:POS>
                 <ns1:Source>
                     <ns1:RequestorID ID="Seller Code"/>
                     <ns1:BookingChannel>
                         <ns1:CompanyName Code="Buyer Code"/>
                     </ns1:BookingChannel>
                 </ns1:Source>
             </ns1:POS>
             ...
             ...
         </ns:request>
   </ns:HotelRatePlanNotif>
 </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

You will find the RequestorID (Seller Code) and CompanyName (Buyer Code) values in the email we will send you once the connection is established.

#### Supported Operations

In the context of the Hotel Push Sellers API, you can both push and retrieve information about **Availability**, **Rates**, and **Inventory** (ARI).

* When you **push data**, you'll need to submit a request to Travelgate's system with all the necessary information about inventory, availability or rate. If everything goes smoothly, you'll receive a successful response and the data will be stored in a TravelgateX database; otherwise, you'll receive an error message.

* On the other hand, when you **retrieve data**, you'll need to send a request to Travelgate's system to get the information you're looking for. If everything goes well, we'll send you the data that was previously stored in our system as a response; otherwise, we'll notify you of an error.

But now, this quickstart guide will focus on the basics of using the Hotel Push Sellers API to push the ARI (Availability, Rates, and Inventory) to Travelgate's system and begin making the first sales, so let's dive in and get started!

### 1. Retrieve the setup of the product (Hotel, Rate Plan, Room).

The Inventory message is where the adventure starts! The aim of this step is to setup (hotel, rate plans, and rooms) your inventory. This step is typically performed by the Buyer; who usually accesses our [Inventory Extranet](https://inventory.xmltravelgate.com/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f) to complete the setup there. Consequently, the Seller typically only needs to retrieve the data to map it into their system and subsequently push the availability and rates. 

:::info

If the Seller prefers to take charge of the inventory setup, it is also possible through [inventory push](availability-rates-and-inventory/inventory/inventory-push) method.

### 2. Push the availability

After a careful review of all the inventory setup retrieved in the previous step, it's time to proceed and push the availability.

### 3. Push the rates

You're almost there! After pushing the availability, it's time to finish the process by pushing the rates. Once this is done, all the information will be in our database, and Buyers will be able to start making their first reservations.

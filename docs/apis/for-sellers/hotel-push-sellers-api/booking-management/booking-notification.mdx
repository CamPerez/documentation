# Booking Notification

During the booking process, we'll send you a `HotelResNotif` request message to share reservation details. You just need to check and let us know the reservation status. After that, Travelgate will handle the response from your system, moving forward with the reservation and updating you on the status.

:::note

If you have the booking locator, include it in the `HotelResNotif` response, this way we'll include it in our response.

:::

Keep in mind that if there's an issue with the reservation in your system, we'll consider it as not successful (NOK) and let you know with an error message.

### Request

The `HotelResNotif` request message provides notifications for bookings.

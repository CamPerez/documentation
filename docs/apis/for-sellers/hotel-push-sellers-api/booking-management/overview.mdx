# Overview

Providers can receive instant API notifications from Travelgate with the `HotelResNotif` message for bookings and the `CancelNotif` message for cancellations. If a provider does not allow push notifications to their system, it is possible to implement `HotelResRetrieve` messages to obtain a list of bookings from the Inventory tool system.

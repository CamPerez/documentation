# Cancel Notification

During the cancellation process, we'll send you a `CancelNotif` request message to inform of the cancellation. You just need to check and let us know the reservation status. After that, Travelgate will handle the response from your system, moving forward with the cancellation process and updating you on the status.

Keep in mind that if the cancellation fails in your system, we'll consider it as not successful (NOK) and let you know with an error message.

### Request

The `CancelNotif` request message provides notifications for cancellations.

### Response

After each request, Travelgate processes the data and provides a response to the Seller. Upon receiving a `CancelNotif` request, Travelgate sends a corresponding `CancelNotif` response. The response options include either **success** or an **error**.

**Success:**

```html
<OTA_HotelResNotifRS xmlns = "http://www.opentravel.org/OTA/2003/05" Timestamp = "2018-09-12T23:09:08+03:00">
    <Success/>

**Error:**

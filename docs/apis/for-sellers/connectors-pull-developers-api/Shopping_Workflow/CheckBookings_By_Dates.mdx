## **Overview**

The `CheckBookings By Dates` operation allows clients to retrieve the status of bookings that fall within a specified date range. It provides a way to list multiple bookings based on criteria such as check-in dates or booking creation dates. This operation is optional but can significantly enhance the functionality of a Connector by providing bulk booking insights.

## **Purpose**

- **Booking Retrieval by Date**: Enables clients to fetch booking details for a given range of dates.
- **Data Insights**: Useful for operational analysis or customer service purposes, such as managing upcoming check-ins or tracking recent bookings.
- **Supplier Compatibility**: Adapts to suppliers that support range-based booking queries.

## **When to Use**

- **Operational Monitoring**: To track all bookings for a specific date range, such as upcoming arrivals.
- **Bulk Booking Insights**: To retrieve booking data for analysis or reporting purposes.
- **Supplier-Specific Use Cases**: When suppliers provide additional insights or booking details for specific date ranges.

## **Date Range Options**

- **Check-in Date**: Fetch bookings based on the guest's check-in date.
- **Booking Date**: Fetch bookings based on when the reservation was created in the supplier's system.

> **Note**: This operation is not mandatory but is highly recommended for suppliers supporting this functionality, as it provides comprehensive booking management capabilities.

## **Response Details**

- **Booking Status**: Indicates whether bookings are active, canceled, or unknown.
- **Locators**: Provides client and supplier locators for each booking.
- **Optional Data**:
  - Guest details.
  - Room information.
  - Payment or cancellation status, depending on the supplier's capabilities.

## **Common Scenarios**

- **Booking Analytics**: Generate reports for all bookings made during a promotional period.
- **Error Handling**:
  - `BookingNotFound`: No bookings found for the specified date range.
  - `SupplierError`: Indicates an issue with the supplier's API, such as unavailability or invalid date formats.

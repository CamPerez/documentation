# California Senate Bill 644 - Buyers

### Overview and Impact on Hotel and Short-Term Rental Bookings

Effective July 1, 2024, the California Senate Bill No. 644 (SB 644) introduces new regulations impacting the hotel and short-term rental industry (more information [here](/docs/âš–%EF%B8%8F%20Legislation/Publications/California%20Law/California-law)).

Travelgate is fully aware of these new regulations and are diligently working to ensure that all our collaborations comply with the established legal requirements. We are reviewing and updating our integrations to align with these laws and minimize any impact on our services.

Please note that *no actions are required from your side.*

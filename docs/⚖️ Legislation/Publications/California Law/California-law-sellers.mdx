# California Senate Bill 644 - Sellers

### Overview and Impact on Hotel and Short-Term Rental Bookings

Effective July 1, 2024, the California Senate Bill No. 644 (SB 644) introduces new regulations impacting the hotel and short-term rental industry (more information [here](/docs/âš–%EF%B8%8F%20Legislation/Publications/California%20Law/California-law)).

Travelgate is currently reviewing our integrations to ensure that all aspects of our collaboration comply with these regulations. To ensure that we are acting in accordance with these new regulations, we need to review and validate our tax responses. 

### What do I need to do?

If you haven't already, we kindly request that you provide us with the following information:

- An example of your response to the taxes applied in accordance with the new California Law. This information is crucial to ensure that we are all aligned and compliant with the established legal requirements.
- The identifier of a hotel affected by the new California Law for which we can make availability calls. Additionally, we need to know the specific dates on which we can request such availability.

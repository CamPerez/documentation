# Travelgate Fixed IP Lists

### How Travelgate IPs Work with Sellers

When you partner with Travelgate as a Seller, the requests we send to your system originate from various IP addresses. Depending on your system’s configuration, these IPs can be handled in different ways:

- **No IP Filtering:** If your system does not restrict specific IP addresses, our dynamic cloud-based environment allows requests to come from different, scalable IPs that may change as needed.
- **IP Filtering:** If your system allows only specific IPs, we provide a fixed list of IP addresses. This ensures all requests consistently originate from the same IPs. Any updates to this list will be communicated promptly so you can update your system accordingly.

If you do not currently filter by IP but would like traffic to come from fixed addresses, contact our Customer Support team. We’ll assess your requirements and explore possible solutions.

## Does Travelgate Need to Whitelist My IPs?
At Travelgate, we ensure that all our IPs are whitelisted in your system. However, our system **does not filter by IP**, meaning there's no need for us to whitelist your IPs. If you experience connectivity issues, they are unlikely to be caused by IP filtering.

## How the IP Management API Supports Your Operations

The new [IP Management API](/docs/security/ip-management-api/quickstart) is a read-only tool that provides Buyers and Sellers with real-time **visibility into the fixed IP addresses used by Travelgate**. It allows you to easily query IP ranges, check their status, and see which services they’re associated with — helping you configure firewall rules and ensure secure, controlled access to services.

Designed to streamline your infrastructure management, this API offers a centralized source of accurate IP data, Boosting operational security. Whether you're managing connectivity as a Buyer or a Seller, it helps keep your systems resilient, reliable, and easy to maintain.

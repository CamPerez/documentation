## How to Request a Payment Type Change for a Partner

If both you and your Partner are under the **Commercial Agreement 2023**, you can request a payment type change via the [Auto-Activations form](/kb/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations/). The available payment types are:

- **FREE**: No cost to you. Your Partner is responsible for the full payment of the connectivity.
- **STD**: Standard booking fee shared between you and your Partner.
- **SUP**: Both standard booking fees and a supplement apply to you, while the connection is free for your Partner.

If you want to switch to a **FREE** arrangement (where your Partner takes on the payment responsibility), your Partner must confirm the change. You can cancel the request if needed.

Changes between **Free to Standard** or **Standard to Supplement** payment types do not require Partner confirmation, as the cost is assumed by the parties involved. These changes are processed automatically.

Additionally, you can access a **historical record** of changes made in each agreement.

- Remember, your Partner must log in to their Profile to accept the payment change request. They will receive a notification in the bell icon located on the right side of the settings menu.
- Any changes to the payment type will apply to all reservations with an entry date starting from the first day of the following calendar month after the notification.
- For **Commercial Agreement 2023**, you can select the payment type during the [auto-activation process](/kb/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations).
- Payment type changes are only available under the **Commercial Agreement 2023**.

### What is an API Key?

An **API key** is a unique alphanumeric identifier used to authenticate requests to Travelgate’s APIs, such as the **Hotel-X Pull Buyers API**. The API key must be included in the **HTTP Authorization** header to verify the requestor’s identity and authenticate the user agent with the server.

In the **API Keys** section, you can manage and view the API keys configured for your Organization, including details such as their creation dates and the ability to generate new ones.

# How can I know the currencies supported by a Seller?

### How can I obtain information about the currencies supported by a specific Seller?ðŸ”Ž
To determine the languages supported by a particular Seller, you can utilize our [Metadata Query](https://knowledge.travelgate.com/hotel-x-development-metadata) method or request this information directly to the Seller.

### And what happens if the Seller doesn't support the currency requested in Search?ðŸ’¡
In this case, two scenarios are possible:

1. The Seller returns an error caused by the currency not being supported by them.
1. The Seller returns the currency set up on their end for your credentials.

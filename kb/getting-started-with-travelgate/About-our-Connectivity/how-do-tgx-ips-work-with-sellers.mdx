# TravelgateX lists of fixed IPs

### How do TravelgateX IPs work with Sellers?

You may already be aware that as a Seller, the requests you receive from TGX originate from various IPs. Different Sellers have different approaches when it comes to filtering IPs on their systems.

Typically, if a Seller's system doesn't filter by IP, our system operates dynamically. This means that our environments utilize new IPs as they scale up or down, leveraging dynamic environments from various cloud providers.

If a Seller's system does filter by IP, we have a fixed IP configuration in place. This ensures that the Seller consistently receives the same IPs from us. If there are any additions or deletions of new IPs, we will promptly notify the Seller, so that they can stay informed and whitelist the new IPs as needed.

If you're a Seller who **doesn't filter by IP** but wants to direct all traffic from the same IPs, simply reach out to our Customer Care team and let us know about your specific requirement and why it's important for you. Our dedicated Teams will carefully assess the feasibility of adjusting your configuration accordingly.

## Does TravelgateX need to whitelist my IPs?💡
At TravelgateX we ensure that all our IPs are whitelisted at the Seller's system. It's important to note that **our system doesn't filter by IP**, and that there is no need for us to whitelist them. If you encounter any errors, rest assured that they are not caused by the IPs.

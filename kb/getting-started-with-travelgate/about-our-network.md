# Unlocking New Opportunities: Connect and Partner with TravelgateX Network!
## Grow your business connections by exploring our Network!
At TravelgateX, we provide tailored recommendations for new connections based on your usage data within our Marketplace. Our advanced algorithms ensure that you not only **expand your Network**, but also increase your booking volume by connecting you with Partners that are most relevant to your trading patterns. 

### How does TravelgateX Partner recommendation work? 🌟
Our suggested connections are carefully selected **based on your performance** and data-driven algorithms. InsightsX thoroughly analyzes your data and cross-references it with global data stored in our Platform. This ensures that Partners who meet your business criteria (listed below) will appear as "Recommended" connections.

* **Your Destinations**: Increase sales in your destinations
* **Your Markets**: Increase your selling markets

And if you want to expand your business:

* **New Destinations**: Expand your business to new destinations!

### Where do I find recommendations for my Company?  🔍
You can access your recommended connections through both your [Dashboard](https://app.travelgatex.com/dashboardhttps://app.travelgatex.com/dashboard) and our [Network](https://app.travelgatex.com/network). Once you've identified a Partner you'd like to connect with, simply arrange your own contract and request their activation. It's that simple!

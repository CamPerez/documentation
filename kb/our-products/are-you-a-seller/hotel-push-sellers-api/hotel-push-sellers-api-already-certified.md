# Hotel Push Sellers API: Already certified, now what?

First of all, congratulations on getting your development of the Hotel Push Sellers API certified! You are now part of the TravelgateX Network, and as a Seller you can proceed to supply your hotel inventory to the Buyers you have established a commercial relationship with.

:::note
At Travelgate, only one side pays for any given connectivity, and whoever assumes financial responsibility for the connection should request the activation of the connection to Travelgate - either the Buyer or the Seller. If you are a Premium Partner, your Buyers never have to worry about connectivity fees, as your partnership with us ensures that your connectivity is always free of cost to any Buyer connected to our marketplace.

### Mapping
Once a new Buyer has been activated, the next step will be them to map your inventory against their own codes.

### Final tests and going live
Ensuring that everything is ready for the launch is vital before going live. That's why, we always recommend to perform the final testing

Once you've confirmed that everything is working properly, then you are ready to go live!

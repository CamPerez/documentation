1. You will be then redirected to our **Availability request form**, where you can specify your Search criteria and send requests - you can also utilize your [own hotel codes](https://docs.travelgatex.com/connectiontypesbuyers/hotel-x/plugins/mapping/) (requesting through your own context) and run requests for multiple Sellers simultaneously by activating the "**Best Price**". By enabling the "Audit Transactions", you will be able to register and retrieve the request and response logs of your Search.

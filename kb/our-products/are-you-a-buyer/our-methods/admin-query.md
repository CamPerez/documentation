# Hotel-X Development - Admin  Query

### What is Hotel-X Admin Query?
The primary purpose of the Admin Query is to provide a summarized view of all account-related details. With the Admin API, you can access a comprehensive list of all entities within your Organization, ensuring seamless connectivity.

### allAccesses Query

The `allAccesses` Query gives you a list of all your available accesses along with their basic information. For security reasons, the password value will be returned as "null." However, if necessary, you can retrieve this information in the "[My Connections](/kb/connections/my-connections/)" section by filtering at the access level.

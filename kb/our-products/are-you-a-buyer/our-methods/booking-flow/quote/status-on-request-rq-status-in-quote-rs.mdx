# Status in Quote response

### What does the status in a Quote response indicate?
When a Quote query is successful, the option returned will include a status field indicating its current state. Status can be categorized into two possible values: OK and RQ:

1. **OK:** The option is available.
2. **RQ:** The availability of the option previously selected is pending to be confirmed by the Seller.

### The Seller returned an "OK" status for the option selected in Search, why do I receive a "RQ" Status in Quote?
Some Sellers may return options with an "OK" status in Search response, and then return a "RQ" status in Quote response. One of the reasons could be that the Seller has cached options on their side.

### What should I do if I receive a status RQ in Quote response?
If you receive status RQ in Quote response, you should run a new Search request and restart the Booking Flow.

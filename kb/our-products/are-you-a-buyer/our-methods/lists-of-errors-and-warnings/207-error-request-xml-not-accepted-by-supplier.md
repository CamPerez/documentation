# 207 error - Request XML not accepted by Supplier

### What does a 207 error mean?💡
You will encounter a 207 error in those cases your request does not align with the Seller's specifications.

### How can I obtain information about the Seller's limitations and minimize errors?
To check the limitations set by the Seller for each method and to prevent errors and unnecessary traffic, we strongly advise utilizing our [Metadata Query](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/our-methods/static-content/hotel-x-metadata-query).

:::tip
Don't forget to check our [Documentation](/docs/apis/for-buyers/hotel-x-pull-buyers-api/content/metadata) and [Hotel-X API Schema](https://api.travelgatex.com/) for further information on the Metadata Query🚀

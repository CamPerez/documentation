# How to set up and load product in Inventory

### How can I configure the set up of my product in Inventory?💡
As a Buyer buying from Channel Managers via our Inventory Solution, you should first [configure the SetUp](https://docs.travelgatex.com/inventory-x/extranet/load-product/setup/) of your contracted hotels. Once you have finished the SetUp, the Channel Manager will be able to retrieve all the information and map it in order to start loading allotment and prices.

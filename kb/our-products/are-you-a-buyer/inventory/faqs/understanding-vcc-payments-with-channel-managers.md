# Navigating VCC Payments and Commissions with Channel Managers

### How can I determine if a Channel Manager supports VCC payment?
To confirm if a specific Channel Manager allows VCC payment, you should directly contact them. Only Channel Managers that have implemented the ReservationNotif method can enable VCC payment.

### Can we negotiate a regular credit arrangement with the supplier if a VCC solution is provided by the Channel Manager?
If the Channel Manager allows card payment, we accept all payment options. Remember that you can configure BookingDatePayment and ArrivalDatePayment at a rate level in the Inventory Extranet, e.g. payment after arrival instead of VCC on arrival.  
However, please note that we do not get involved in the payment terms between the Channel Manager and the Client. It is advisable to confirm this directly with your Channel Manager.

### Can you provide a list of Channel Managers that offer VCC Payment via Travelgate?

### Which Channel Managers handle commission? Can we use net prices for all?
In our system, the Channel Manager (CM) is responsible for loading availability and prices and then you have the flexibility to set a commission at the rate level on the Inventory extranet. This means that if the CM loads net prices, you can add a commission percentage in the rate configuration. As a result, you will receive the price both with and without commission via API.

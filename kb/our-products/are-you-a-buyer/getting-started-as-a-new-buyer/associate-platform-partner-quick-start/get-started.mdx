### Step 3: Configure and Retrieve your TravelgateX credentials✔️
In this step, you will configure and obtain your TravelgateX credentials. Follow the instructions provided to ensure you have the necessary access to our Platform.

1. **Hotel-X Pull Buyers API🚀**

	_You need to follow this step only if you are connected to our Network through our Hotel-X Pull Buyers API._

	- **API Key🔎**  
		An Apikey is a unique alphanumeric code that serves as a form of authentication required for accessing Hotel-X API. This key must be included in the HTTP Authorization request header to verify and authenticate the user agent with the server. It acts as a secure identifier, ensuring that only authorized users can make requests and access the API's functionalities. You can find your Apikey (**encrypted**) and generate new ones in section Connections > [API Settings](https://app.travelgatex.com/connections/settings).

		For further details, check out our "Hotel-X Credentials" [article](/kb/our-products/are-you-a-buyer/getting-started-with-hotel-x-buyers-api/hotel-x-credentials).

	- **Clients:🔎**  
		The Client names help recognize the company making the request. Since you are an Associate Platform Partner, you should create a Client for each of the Customers buying accommodation through you from any of the Sellers connected to our Network.

		To create new Clients, log onto our website and access our "Connections" menu. Then, select "Connection Settings":

		You can create as many clients as the number of Customers you work with; there are no restrictions.

	:::note
	Remember, when making requests through Hotel-X API, use the client associated with the Customer who made the request on your end.

1. **Legacy Pull Buyers API🚀**

	_You need to follow this step **only** if you are connected to our Network through our Legacy Pull Buyers API._

	- **Hubusers and Passwords🔎**  
		The Hubusers and Passwords help recognize the Organization making the request. Since you are an Associate Platform Partner, you should create a Hubuser and a Password for each of the Customers buying accommodation through you from any of the Sellers connected to our Network.

		To create new Hubuser and Password, log onto our website and click in the "Connections" menu. Then, select "Connection Settings":

		![associate_platform_quickguide_7](https://storage.travelgate.com/kbase/associate_platform_quickguide_7.jpg)

### Step 4: Activate new Sellers✔️
Now, let's start by requesting connections. Just follow these easy [steps](/kb/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations) to send your activation requests.

As an Associate Platform Partner, your Customers might have unique credentials for each Seller. This means you might need to request **multiple connections with the same Seller, each for a different Customer**.

To keep things clear, we recommend **adding specific names to your connections**. For example: clientname_sellername. Additionally, you might also have **several credentials for a single connection Customer-Seller**, such as B2B and B2C credentials. In this case, we also recommend using clear names for easy identification. For instance: clientname_sellername_b2b.

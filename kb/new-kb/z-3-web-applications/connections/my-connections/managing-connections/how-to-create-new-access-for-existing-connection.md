# How to add a new access for an existing connection

In cases where you already have a connection with one of our Partners and only need to **add additional credentials (new accesses)**, you can do so directly at the connection level in "My Connections."

Simply follow these steps:
1. Go to the "My Connections" section on our website and filter for the desired connection.
2. Click on the blue “Add New Access” button next to the found accesses.
3. Fill out the [connection form](/kb/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations) to add the information for your new credentials with that Partner.
4. That's it! You have requested the activation of a new access for the selected connection. Easy, right?

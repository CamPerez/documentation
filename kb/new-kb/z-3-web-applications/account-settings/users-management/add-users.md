5. **Complete the sign-up process**: The new user will receive an email to set their password. Please ensure the first login is done using the **username and password**, rather than logging in via a Google account.

### User Roles
Each user’s role determines what actions they can perform within the Travelgate platform:
- **Admin**: Can create new connections and make reservations via the Travelgate app and API.
- **Editor**: Can review and update existing connections and make reservations.
- **Viewer**: Can view existing connections and perform searches and quotes.

# Update Standard Occupancy

## How to Modify the Standard Occupancy of a Room

### Step 1: Confirm Price Consistency

Before modifying the **Standard Occupancy**, be aware that **failure to remap and refresh** on the Channel Managerâ€™s side may lead to **price discrepancies**. If the Channel does not update its mapping and reloads the product, the pricing may become inconsistent.

:::danger **Important:**
Ensure that you **notify the Channel Manager** about any Standard Occupancy modifications so they can remap and refresh their data.  
We strongly recommend **deleting previously loaded prices** before the Channel Manager remaps and reloads their product to prevent pricing discrepancies.

### Step 2: Request a Modification

Once you have **informed the Channel Manager**, follow these steps:

1. Contact our **[Customer Support team](https://app.travelgate.com/support)**.
2. Provide details of the **hotel, rate, and room** for which you need the Standard Occupancy modification.

Thatâ€™s it! Our team will handle the request accordingly.

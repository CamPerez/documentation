# Quick guide to auto-connections

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of requesting a connection with one of our Partners via the TravelgateX Marketplace. We aim to make this journey as straightforward and seamless as possible, ensuring you can easily connect with your chosen partners and enhance your business opportunities. We had, and still have, only one objective: to make connecting a Partner easier and faster. 

## **How can I request a new connection?**

1. Log onto [TravelgateX](https://www.travelgatex.com/).

2. Head over to the "Connections" > "My connections" section. Before you begin, double-check that you're logged into the correct Organization and Partner profile type (Buyer or Seller). If you're unsure, you can find this information in the top right corner of your screen.

:::warning
It's worth noting that having a commercial contract with TravelgateX is a must to request a new connection. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to our friendly Sales Team at sales.support@travelgate.com.

3. Click on "Create a new connection" and let's get started with the steps for a smooth connection process.
    * **Step 1 (Partner):** Choose the Partner you want to connect with. Some Sellers may offer multiple connection types ([Pull or Push](/kb/getting-started-with-travelgate/About-our-Connectivity/what-is-the-difference-between-pull-and-push-sellers)), so pick the one that suits you best.
    * **Step 2 (Access configuration):** Let's dive into configuring your access with the Partner! Firstly, assign a distinctive name to your access, perhaps indicating whether it's intended for B2B or B2C operations. Next, specify whether it's for testing purposes or if it's ready to go live. Then, complete the form with the credentials provided by the Seller. Keep in mind that each Seller may require different information based on their system's specifications. It's important to note that activating your access with credentials that haven't been greenlit by the Seller can disrupt the workflow and cause delays. Therefore, ensure that your credentials are active and fully operational before proceeding.
    * **Step 3 (Notification setup):** Let us know where you'd like to receive notifications once the activation is created and access is granted.
    * **Step 4 (Review and confirm):**: Double-check all the provided information and confirm to kick off the auto-activation process. Once complete, we'll send you an email containing all the necessary information to set the connection live. Easy peasy!

:::warning Important
Please bear in mind that by requesting the activation of a connection, you are assuming financial responsibility with TravelgateX for this connection.

### Connections via Legacy Pull Buyers API

Please remember that when Buyer connections are established through our Legacy Pull Buyers API, updates to a given set of credentials (Hotel-X Access Codes) must be addressed not only through My Connections (at the access level), but also directly at the **Buyer's system** (Legacy configuration stored on their end) to ensure the information is consistent. It is not enough to merely update the Hotel-X Access Code in My Connections.

:::info
As a Seller, you can determine if your Buyers are using the Hotel-X Pull Buyers API by checking the label on their Buyer card in the ["My Connections"](/kb/connections/my-connections/#what-can-i-find-in-my-connections) section.

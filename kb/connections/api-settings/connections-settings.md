			When creating a new client, you'll be required to provide a client name. By default, all new clients will be granted full access. This means that if your Search query doesn't specify any access, and you only use the client, all accesses will be applied:

			If you wish to assign specific accesses to a particular client, you can make adjustments by selecting the "Edit default accesses" option:

			Simply uncheck the checkbox to grant the client full access by default, and then use the access boxes to choose only specific ones:

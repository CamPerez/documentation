# Error BD

### What Does an "Error BD" Mean?

An **"Error BD"** typically occurs when a user attempts to add two master rooms with identical codes in the Inventory Extranet, creating a conflict when adding a new room to a hotel. The error is also related to the message: **"An item with the same key has already been added,"** which may appear when editing a room that has already been duplicated.

### What Can I Do If I Receive an "Error BD" When Adding a Room in the Inventory Extranet?

To prevent this error, **avoid duplicating room codes under any circumstances**. If multiple team members are working on hotel setup at the same time, ensure proper coordination. Team members should work on different properties or sections to avoid overlapping actions, which can lead to database conflicts.

### How can I request a payment type change for one of my Partners?💡


1. It's possible that you and your Partner are currently splitting the cost of the connection under a Standard Payment Agreement. If you're interested in switching to a free arrangement where your Partner takes on the payment responsibility, you'll need to **wait for their acceptance** before proceeding with the change. If needed, you can also cancel the request.

1. Other modifications, such as switching from **Free to Standard** or **Standard to Supplement**, do not require Partner confirmation as the total cost of the connection is assumed. These changes can be processed automatically.
1. Additionally, you will have access to the **historical record** of changes made in each agreement:

:::warning
- Keep in mind that your Partner needs to log in through their Profile to **accept the payment change request**. They will receive a notification in the **bell-shaped icon** located on the right side of the settings menu.
- Any changes made to the payment type will apply to all reservations with an entry date starting from the first day of the following calendar month after the notification.
- Remember, if you have an agreement 2023, you will have the option to **choose the Payment Type** during the [auto-activation process](https://knowledge.travelgate.com/the-auto-activation-process). If you are not familiar with this process, we also recommend taking a look at the following article [Important points when requesting a new connection](https://knowledge.travelgate.com/before-activation-request).

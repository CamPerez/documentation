# Billing: View your agreements, control your usage, and check your invoices 

## Billing Key Definitions🔎
   - **GMV (Gross Merchandise Value):** total value of all reservations made through the platform, based on check-ins. Canceled reservations are excluded (except non-refundable rates).
   - **STD (Standard Booking Fee):** rate applied to the GMV, monthly by check-in. It represents the shared cost between the parties involved in the connection.
   - **SUP (Supplement fee):** additional charge to the standard booking fee (STD) if either the Buyer or Seller decides to cover the cost for the other party (SUP), or if the supplier is a direct product such as Channel Manager, Switch or Hotel (SUP_DP).
   - **FREE:** The connection has no cost for you. The counterpart fully covers the cost of the connection.

:::warning important
To ensure seamless billing, **it's important that you handle all cancellations via our API**.

### How can I request a payment type change for one of my Partners?

It's possible that you and your Partner are currently splitting the cost of the connection under a Standard Payment Agreement (STD). If you're interested in switching to a free arrangement where your Partner takes on the payment responsibility, you'll need to **wait for their acceptance** before proceeding with the change. If needed, you can also cancel the request.

Other modifications, such as switching from **Free to Standard** or **Standard to Supplement**, do not require Partner confirmation as the total cost of the connection is assumed. These changes can be processed automatically.

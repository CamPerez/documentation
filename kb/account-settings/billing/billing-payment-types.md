# How to choose your payment type at Travelgate

Welcome to our comprehensive guide for selecting the payment type at TravelgateX!

If both you and your Partner are under the **Commercial Agreement 2023**, the [Auto-Activations form](/kb/connections/my-connections/guick-guide-to-auto-activations/) to request a new connection on our Platform will display these available payment types:

- **FREE:** This connection has no cost for you. Your Partner must confirm the full payment of the connectivity from its side.
- **STD:** Standard booking fee applies for you and your Partner, share costs.
- **SUP:** Both standard booking fees and supplement apply to this connection for you. For your Partner, it will be free.

Simply review these options with your Partner and choose the one that best suits your needs!

Remember, you can also **request a change in the payment type** through our ["Billing" section](/kb/account-settings/billing/billing-how-to-check-agreements-usage-invoices#how-can-i-request-a-payment-type-change-for-one-of-my-partners) by clicking on the "Agreements" tab and selecting the connection for which you want to request a change in the applicable payment type.

- If you're interested in switching to a free arrangement where your Partner takes on the payment responsibility, you'll need to wait for their acceptance before proceeding with the change. If needed, you can also cancel the request.
- Other modifications, such as switching from Free to Standard or Standard to Supplement, do not require Partner confirmation as the total cost of the connection is assumed. These changes can be processed automatically.

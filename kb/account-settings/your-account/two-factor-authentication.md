# Two-factor Authentication (2FA)

:::warning Important
Effective **September 10th, 2024**, our website will require 2FA for all users.
:::

### What is the Two-factor Authentication?

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to your Travelgate account. Once enabled, you will be required to enter a security code in addition to your password whenever you sign in.

This code will be newly generated each time by an authenticator application (we call it a “One-Time Password”). This is why a prerequisite is that you have an authenticator app already installed (we recommend having Google Authenticator in your phone, but this is only one of many existing apps). Some examples:
- Google Authenticator ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) & [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)).
- Microsoft Authenticator ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator) & [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458)).
- Cisco Duo Mobile ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duosecurity.duomobile) & [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duo-mobile/id422663827)).

3. **Open Authenticator App**: Open your authenticator app and select the option to add a new configuration key.
4. **Scan or Manually Enter Key**:
   1. The app will usually ask if you want to scan a QR code or manually enter the configuration key. The easiest way to proceed is by scanning the QR code.
   2. If you cannot scan the QR code, click on the link "Trouble Scanning?". A new screen will appear with the configuration key for manual entry in your app.

   1. That's all you need to set up our 2FA for the first time.
   2. The next screen will confirm that everything is set up correctly and you will be redirected to your new log-in page.

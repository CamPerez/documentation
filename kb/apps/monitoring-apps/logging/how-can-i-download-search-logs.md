# How to download Search logs

Just imagine the enormous task of storing the astounding number of search transactions, exceeding 6 billion, that occur daily at TravelgateX. As a result, **we have opted not to store search transaction logs by default**.

### What can I do if I need Search logs in order to identify an error or to solve a dispute?💡
1. Head to the “Audit Search Logs” option.
1. Indicate the connection or access you need Search logs from. You will also be able to check the Audit Searches History for further details on your previous audits.
1. Our APP will start saving **5% of your Search traffic for 5 minutes**.

The audit process may no be immediate, please wait a few minutes to recover the logs in the Logging APP and remember to filter by **“Search”** Operation type.
